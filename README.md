# NBA 3v3 Team Generator
This is my first project prompted by Codecademy using Javasctipt. 
![alt text](https://img.17qq.com/images/hrurhteascx.jpeg "NBA Logo")

This program utilizes javascript, git version control, and the console.
The prompt requested that the program should be truly random, and outputs
should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 

## The Build

> I chose to store the nba players that would make up the random teams as 
> an object of arrays.  The program iterates through each property of the
> object and selects a random value from the attached array using Math.random()

### The Output
```
